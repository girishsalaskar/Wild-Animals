First of All Welcome to the Wild Animals Website!  Wild animals are a fascinating and joy-inspiring part of our world.  We can learn so much by studying them and learning more about the habitats, food webs, and social communities to which they belong.  Did you know that many different kinds of scientists study animals -- to learn more about the human world?  It's true!  
<br><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ecologists learn about human kind's place in the fragile web of life by studying the needs and health of the animals (and plants) that share our planet.  Meanwhile, psychologists and anthropologists learn about human evolution, social bonding, reproductive drives and much more by studying the habits and anatomy of non-human, animal relatives (both distant and near).  Even medical doctors learn from animals by studying their venoms, bacteria, self-healing abilities and so on in an effort to unlock new ways to heal the human body.
<br><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But as the great naturalist John Muir taught us, animals -- and in fact all of our natural world -- offer another kind of benefit as well.  And that is that quiet time spent out in nature,  observing wildlife, has the power to uplift the human spirit.  The beauty, courage, and tenderness of animals touches us. 
<br><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And outdoors, surrounded by the wonder of nature, a sense of quite joy, of wonder, wells up inside us.  For a moment, we simply ARE.   Perhaps we even notice that our human mind, with all it's busy thoughts, is not the only important force in the world.  Life itself, flowing from a power greater than ourselves, is at work all around us.  And we are a part of that Life. 
<br><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe invite you to spend more time with the animals.  Visit a wildlife preserve.  Play with your pet.  Observe the animals that live in the zoo.  Observe with your heart as well as your mind.  See what you find out.<br><br>
